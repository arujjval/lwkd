## Featured PRs

[134433 : kubeadm print errors during control-plane-wait retries](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134433)

This PR improves troubleshooting during control plane startup by ensuring that errors encountered while waiting for control plane components are printed during each retry at log verbosity level 5. Previously, these errors were not shown, which made it harder to identify issues when components failed to become ready. With this change, administrators can now see the actual errors without additional steps, making failure causes more visible and debugging faster.
