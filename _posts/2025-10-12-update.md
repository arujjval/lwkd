## Developer News

The ballots for the Steering Committee Elections are due on October 24th. If you haven't already, [submit your Steering votes]( https://elections.k8s.io). If you have contributed to Kubernetes in the last year but havenâ€™t met the eligibility requirements, you will need to submit an [exception request](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2025#voter-exception) to vote in the steering election, the deadline for which is October 22nd.

The [CFPs for Maintainer Summit: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2026](https://sessionize.com/maintainer-summit-eu-2026/) are open. Please send in your submissions before 14th December 2025.

## Featured PRs

[134433 : kubeadm print errors during control-plane-wait retries](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134433)

This PR improves troubleshooting during control plane startup by ensuring that errors encountered while waiting for control plane components are printed during each retry at log verbosity level 5. Previously, these errors were not shown, which made it harder to identify issues when components failed to become ready. With this change, administrators can now see the actual errors without additional steps, making failure causes more visible and debugging faster.


## KEP of the Week
[KEP-4622: New TopologyManager Policy which configure the value of maxAllowableNUMANodes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4622-topologymanager-max-allowable-numa-nodes/README.md)

This KEP introduces a new TopologyManager policy option called `max-allowable-numa-nodes`, allowing users to configure the maximum number of NUMA nodes supported by the TopologyManager. Previously, this value was hardcoded to 8 as a temporary measure to prevent state explosion. By making it configurable, the KEP enables better support for high-end CPUs with more than 8 NUMA nodes, without changing existing TopologyManager policies or addressing broader resource management aspects.

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.35
