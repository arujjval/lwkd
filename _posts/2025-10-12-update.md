## KEP of the Week
[KEP-4622: New TopologyManager Policy which configure the value of maxAllowableNUMANodes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4622-topologymanager-max-allowable-numa-nodes/README.md)

This KEP introduces a new TopologyManager policy option called `max-allowable-numa-nodes`, allowing users to configure the maximum number of NUMA nodes supported by the TopologyManager. Previously, this value was hardcoded to 8 as a temporary measure to prevent state explosion. By making it configurable, the KEP enables better support for high-end CPUs with more than 8 NUMA nodes, without changing existing TopologyManager policies or addressing broader resource management aspects.

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.35
