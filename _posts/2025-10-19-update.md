## Developer News

SIG-Etcd has [found another potential upgrade failure](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/20793) preventing some users upgrading to etcd 3.6. The [blog gives instructions](https://etcd.io/blog/2025/upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue_followup/) on steps to avoid it, mainly updating to [3.5.24](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.5.24).

## KEP of the Week
[KEP-4742: Expose Node Topology Labels via Downward API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4742-node-topology-downward-api/README.md)

This KEP introduces a built-in Kubernetes admission plugin that automatically copies node topology labels (like zone, region, or rack) onto Pods. It allows Pods to access this topology data through the Downward API without using privileged init containers or custom scripts. The change simplifies topology-aware workloads such as distributed AI/ML training, CNI optimizations, and sharded databases, making topology awareness a secure and native part of Kubernetes.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.35.
